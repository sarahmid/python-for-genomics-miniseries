For lists, the unit is elements of the list. We'll talk about others as they come up.\n",

However, the editor will use the locations of the `\\n` characters to figure out where the end of each line should be. If you somehow removed all the `\\n` from your original file, your editor would think everything should be on the same line! \n",
    "   - Different operating systems use different line endings. Linux and modern Macs use `\\n`, so this is what you'll see most often. Windows uses `\\r\\n` as the line ending, however, which can cause issues sometimes. \n",
