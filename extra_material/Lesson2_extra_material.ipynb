    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually several different ways to import modules that can make them easier to work with. Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    import math, random\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give a module an alias and use that in your code (good when module name is long):\n",
    "\n",
    "    import random as rnd\n",
    "    rnd.randint(1,100)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import individual functions from a module (note that if you do this, you must call the function WITHOUT prefixing it):\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import log10\n",
    "    log10(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import all functions as above if you use * (so then you can use all functions without prefixing with the module name):\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import *\n",
    "    sqrt(64)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this last variation is generally not considered to be a good programming practice because it can lead to a lot of confusion in large scripts with many modules in use (someone reading your script who is not familiar with the modules might have a very hard time figuring out where all these functions are coming from!). Use it sparingly, if at all.\n"

    "\n",
    "![pydocs2](../images/pydocs2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has one required parameter (iterable) and three optional parameters. However, in order to use the last optional parameter (reverse), you must use all the previous optional parameters as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, here are all the possibilities that are allowed for this function:\n",
    "```\n",

    "sorted(iterable, key)\n",
